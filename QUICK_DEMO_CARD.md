## 💰 ROI CALCULATOR (Quick Math)

**Client has X claims/month:**

```
Annual Savings = X claims/month × 12 months × 8% fraud rate × $400 avg fraud

Examples:
- 1,000 claims/month = $384,000/year
- 5,000 claims/month = $1.92M/year
- 10,000 claims/month = $3.84M/year
- 50,000 claims/month = $19.2M/year
```

**System Cost:** ~$0.07/claim = $700-$3,500/month
**ROI:** 450x to 550x
