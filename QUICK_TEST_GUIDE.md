## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If form doesn't update:**
- ✅ Check browser console (F12) for errors
- ✅ Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- ✅ Try hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- ✅ Clear browser cache

**If visual feedback doesn't show:**
- ✅ Some browsers disable animations if system is in battery saver mode
- ✅ The form will still update, just without the highlight

**If "Expected range" doesn't update (demo mode):**
- ✅ Check that updateExpectedAmount() function is being called
- ✅ Verify CPT Code dropdown has data-base and data-max attributes
